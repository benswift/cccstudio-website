The **code/creativity/culture group** (c/c/c) is a research group within the
Research School of Computer Science. Our goal is to create spaces for _talking_,
_thinking_ and _making_ about the way that **code** (software), **creativity**
(especially the arts) and **culture** (life) intersect in the modern world.

The fact that these things *do* intersect is hopefully not controversial in {{
'now' | date: "%Y" }}; the challenge is to create opportunities to talk about it
that make people care enough to pay attention. Musical livecoding (for examples,
check out [Ben's vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/269115310) or [LENS, the c/c/c
laptop ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/lens/)) is
one example of the public display (and hopefully discussion) of code, but
different intersections will interest different folks, so this is a challenge we
need to address from multiple angles.

It's also really important that we ask the deeper questions about the artefacts
that we build---especially as computer scientists (even multi-disciplinary
ones). Programmers are writing the rules which govern (literally in some cases)
the way that society works, and we're long past the point where we can say "what
people *do* with this stuff isn't my problem". Code, creativity and culture are
bleeding into one another more and more, and we're excited about starting
conversations about how it all works and what it means.

The c/c/c group isn't for luddites or techno-chauvinists; what we want to do is
give everyone a reason to start talking about these code/creativity-culture
intersections, and to raise the level of discourse about the opportunities and
challenges.
